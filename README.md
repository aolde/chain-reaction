Game idea
---------
The goal of this game is to get as many explosions as possible. The more explosions you get in a chain reaction - the more points you get.

Running the game locally
------------------------
Browsers like Google Chrome does not allow local files to load ajax requests. Because of this you need to either upload the game to a web server or disable this security permission.

In Google Chrome you can do this by adding `--allow-file-access-from-files` to the command args for Chrome.
